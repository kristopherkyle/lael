I agree with the topic that the smoking should be banned because I think the smoking is a bad effect to both oneself and others. So all restaurants in the country should ban smoking for costumer's health and all workers that work in the restaurants. There are two reasons that the smoking should completely banned are first, the smoking gives some diseases to others, second, the smoking may lead the poverty to someone who smoked. First, the smoking gives some diseases to others. Most customers would like to get the fresh air when they are eating in the restaurant. If there is someone who is smoking there, how the customers feel. They might not happy and leave the restaurant. Some of them might get a caught because they smell the smoke. And the smoking may give them some diseases such as heart disease, cancer and so on. Someone may have allergies from smoking. They might get sick or their health might be bad. In addition, the smoking could reduce the restaurant's quality and credit because the customer won't come back again and they might tell their friend to not coming to the restaurant. Second, the smoking may lead the poverty to someone who smoked. The cigarette must use money to buy it, if you want more money, what happen.
﻿I personally agree that the college students to have a part time job for three reasons. Firstly, some students are poor so they might make money from easy job. They can work in many place like gas station, 7-11, cartoon shops. For sure, the students would like to get money for their study; they can get the money from the part time job and can pay for everything about studying e. g. equipments, study fee course, clothes. Second, they will get some new experiences from their working more than studying in class. The teacher told me that experience outside is thing you can't buy by money. Working may give both good and bad thing to students but they can learn from their mistakes to make their life better. I think if we can learn from mistakes, we will be careful next time. Finally, the students are so proud when they get their own money by themselves. Not only themselves to be so proud but I think parents are so proud too. Absolutely, the part time job is significant for the college student to improve their life, to learn new experiences and to get money by their fighting. So, the college student should have part time job.
