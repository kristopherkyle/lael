I agree to a large extent that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are so many health hazards smoking can cost to not only the smoker him or herself but also people around them. A restaurant is for a place to eat and enjoy our food, however, with all the cigarette smells, it can also affect one's appetite. Secondly, innocent passive smokers causes even more harm compared to the first-hand smokers. The exposure of these smoke or tobacco can cause several diseases like lung cancer and in some cases, even death, which shows that it is a potential hazard. These risks are not what the they wanted when they are dining in a restaurant. Thus, it should be banned in restaurants. Besides, doing so can advocate the potential risks of smoking. I find that if smoking were to be completely banned initially, it can arise certain objections. I suggest that there should be a smoking corner or room which is completely seperated from the non-smokers diners who wants to simply enjoy their meals. And overtime, slowly increasing the number of restaurants that ban smoking. Thus, in conclusion, smoking should be completed banned at restaurants due to all the potential health risks posed to smokers and people around them. 
﻿I largely agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As many of us may know, studying in a college or a university is very costly if without any scholarships or financial support. If college students does not get a job, this means that they can only get the money from their parents or get a loan. Some may argue that students should just focus on studying and not be obsessed about earning money at this point in time. I beg to differ. College students should get a part-time job as they can learn to be independent especially when they are of a young adult age. By getting a part-time job not only expands one's social circle, it also prepares them for whats coming after university, which is working life. Only by experiencing the difficulties and challenges of a work life, they can then understand the money they have earned was not so easy afterall and spend it thriftly. By just asking parents for money, they may not even know how hard it is to strive in a working life, until they experience it themselves. Thus, in conclusion, i find that it is important for college students to get a part-time job, however, if they are already struggling with balancing both studies and working, they should better manage their time and reduce a little on the working hours.
