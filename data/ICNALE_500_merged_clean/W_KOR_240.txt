Smoking has been known to be very harmful to respiratory organs, and it is pointed as the main cause of cancer. However, tens of thousands of people are smoking still, because they have been addicted already. Thus, it is important to provide a strong opportunity to quit the smoking. People are smoking to relieve their stress, but it's not the good solution because it can bring the bigger problem like lung cancer. Further, it can harm to other people who don't smoke, because when smoking people breathing out, the ingredients contained in the smoke can affect the other people. In other word, people can die for smoking. However, the problem is that it is not easy to quit the cigarette. How can we pull them up from smoking? How can we save them from smoking? We can use the strategy of punish, and one of punish can be banning smoke at all the restaurants in the country. It can decrease the chances of smoke happening, because they will pay a pretty penny when they don't follow the regulation. Helping them by banning the smoke seems too progressive, but it could be an appropriate solution to help them move out from the addiction. Moreover, we can use the fine collected from the smokers to help other poor people. In sum, I agree to make a restrict zone in our life zone.
﻿College students are at the stage of being an adult. Being an adult means being independent in terms of mentally, physically, and economically. Therefore they need to practice to make money step by step. And having a part-time job is a good way to practice it. College students need to earn money because they start to independent from their original family. After graduate high school, usually they are treated as an adult, and it pushes college students to have opportunity to have a job. However, because they have to study at college, I think a part-time job is better than full-time job. Although the money is smaller than full time job, they can experience work field. Further, they can learn work ethics from their work. Second, experiencing real work field let them know themselves. For example, they can find their aptitude from the work experiences. And it is possible to lie down a specific job when it does not match with one's aptitude. In my case, I could realize my aptitude from internship on my summer vacation. Third, while working in the real field, students can learn what to study more to get a real job. Students are the people who have the opportunity to learn more. Though the ability student has now is not perfect, he/she has the chance and time to make up. And I think a part time job provides the chance.
