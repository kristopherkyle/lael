Having a part-time job is a good chance to let child learn the importance of money. The will make allowance in good use, thinking twice before spend. Last but most importance is that students can learn how to interact with others from having part-time jobs. The process when they work can be a experience and good lesson in their future life. According the reasons I have mentioned above, I agree that having a part-time job is importance for students' colleges.
