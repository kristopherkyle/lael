I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Universities have raised steadily the tuition. Some parents can no longer afford the fee. So. Students are working part-time to earn his pocket money. I think that the part-time job will be an invaluable experience before social life. And many college students are working for his school expenses. Students work several part-time a day. They work mostly at a convenience store and restaurant and cafe and parcel service. They work hard, and don't earn much. Because student receive unfair treatment to reason young. It cannot be justified any reason. They combine study and part-time. It's not easy to combining. I'm done it before. I'm too tired physically and emotionally. The part-time job demand too much time. Students sleep to catch up on his sleep in the class. So, students have become indifference from study. Part-time job is important to them. We are no telling that quit the part-time. Because par-time is maintain their existence. So, university should arrange ways that scholarship system increase etc. They have to help practically to students suffering from financial hardship. Therefore I consent that it is significant for university students to have a part-time job.
﻿I agree opinion that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are too many non-smoking area in the restaurant. There are restaurant well observe the law. But, the rule in many restaurants is widely ignored. The smell of smoke is very harmful to nonsmokers. Many people are damaged from second-hand smoking. What are the effects of second-hand smoke? Second-hand smoke can cause life-threatening diseases such as lung cancer. So, secondhand smoking is very bad to health. I have bad remember in a restaurant. When we were eating delicious food, man was smoking continue towards me at the next table, I really hate a smoke smell. The restaurant provides a good service and taste good. But, I was getting a very bad headache from the smoking smell. Smoker doesn't know any shame. They have a lot of shameless. Also, they got no consideration for others. If smokers want to smoke, they will have to go outside. They Also, the restaurant owner should follow the rule exhaustively and not be left to smoking. I want to non-smoking eat delicious meal without suffering. Therefore, I approve opinion that Smoking has to be completely banned at all the restaurants.
