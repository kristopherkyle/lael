"Why college students should have part-time jobs?" I think this topic is so faithless for me, because if the college students have their part-time jobs in their free time instead doing their homework or reading their books, their will waste their essential free time that their parents want them to do their best at learning. The things that the college students should really do are pay attention on their learning and their study responsibilities. My reasons that show why college students shouldn't have a part-time job are 3 reasons. First, they must to do their best on their studying so they mustn't waste their free time for doing the part-time job. They must use their essential free time for reading books or something else that will make them improve their learning ability. Second, their parents must to work hard for sending them the money for their learning at the university. It's not a few money, but it is a lot of money that they have to sacrifice their energy and their time for it!!! Third, the part-time jobs will make them tried, and will result in their studying. They will feel tried, don't want to learn and they may be slept in their class. So, these reasons make me believe that the part-time jobs are not suit to college students.
