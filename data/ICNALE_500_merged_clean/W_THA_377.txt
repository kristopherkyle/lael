"Do not smoke in this area" we often saw the message about this in every public place. For example in hospitals, schools, Univesity, resturants etc. It is a good banner way to stop the person who usually smoke in public area. I think the place that should be banned smoking is restaurants. Because it is a place that many people go there for relaxed. For example the older people, childent etc. the owner of erery restaurants should be taking care about this. This essay I would like to disscuse about should be banned smoke in restaurants or not. The restaurants is a public plase the everyone usually go ther. It dose not good if some person smoking in restaurants durring another people are eating food. Some people think restaurants is a relaxed place, everyone can do everything we want. But I think smoking in restaurants is a bad behavior. The person who smoke should be in smoking area. It is better than inside restaurants. Some restaurants also self cigarette for the customer. That way some people often smoke in restaurants that they have to go. The owen should pay respected with law banned smoking. If in the restaurants have no smoking area I think the owner should control the guest that want to smoke to go out side. because some women allergiy the tobacco smoke. Everyone will be happy and enjoy eating if the restaurant wihtout tobacco smoke. The restaurants owner should be serious about this. Because it is a service job and the customer go there for spending their relaxed time.
﻿It is seems that a part time job is increasing in Thailand. Many University students also work during study. Because it is a good way to make money for paying something necessary for their studying life. Moreover a part time can help the students take responsible and taking care of themselves. I agree with this; the students should have a part time job. So in this essay I'd like to explain in two reasons of important part time job. First is students can make money during study. Second is part time job give us a good experience. Many parents agree with a part time job of their child. Nowadays many family can't afford for their children college. Part time job is a good choice for the teenager who want to study in University, but have no money. It is very easy to find a funny job. The teenager can find a job in fast food restaurant. For example KFC, Mister donut, The pizza etc. Some of my friends only study in University. They never have a part time job during summer or study. When they finish college I think it so hard to learn about work of them. If we have a part time job, we also learn to live with another person in society. We can meet many people and work with them through our service. A good time and experience will teach us in social working life. In conclusion I think a part time job is important for college students. Because it is the base way to prepare their life before get a degree. A pert time job can make us happy and funny during work and it is the first step of our work life.
