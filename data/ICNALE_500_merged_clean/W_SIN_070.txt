I agree with this statement to a certain extent. Usually by the time students get to college, their daily allowances given by parents may not be sufficient. This is because there are not as many restrictions for college students as compared to being at a younger age, so they can hang out longer and more often with friends and therefore increasing their expenditures. They are also easily influenced on their wants over needs which may result in overspending. Not all parents are willing to hand out extra cash to their children to satisfy their wants instead of needs. Getting a part-time job helps to sustain their lifestyles and enables them to spend whatever they earn, or there are also others who want to save can save more compared to relying only on their allowances. Some students may also think that they are old enough to take care of themselves and not rely on their parents all the time so they will earn their own allowances by getting a part-time job. Although most students tend to get part-time jobs, there are also those who do not need a job at all because their families have higher incomes and are willing to support and maintain their children's lifestyles. The parents can just give them whatever money they ask for and buy them whatever they want. 
﻿I agree with this statement to a large extent. Nowadays most, if not all restaurants are air-conditioned. If smoking is allowed inside then the whole restaurant will smell and those people who do not smoke will suffer. Smoking is bad for health; even the government has anti-smoking campaigns set up and help hotlines to aid people who want to quit smoking. It is said that non-smokers who breathe in second-hand smoke have a higher chance of getting cancer compared to smokers themselves. Since smoking and breathing in the smoke is so unhealthy, the government must do whatever it can to help those who do not smoke and also try to reduce the number of people lighting up cigarettes. Restaurants should completely ban smoking so as to inconvenience the smokers whenever they feel like puffing and they have to finish their food then go outside for a puff. If they are allowed to smoke inside the restaurant, it will be so convenient for them and the smokers will not think twice about lighting up a cigarette. They will stay longer in the restaurant and some may smoke more than one cigarette during the meal. Non-smokers will have to bear with the smoke and end up with having the smell on their clothes and hair which may be irritating to some.
