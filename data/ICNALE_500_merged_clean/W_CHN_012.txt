Today, more and more college students tend to have a part-time job. Is it good or bad? As far as I am concerned, it depends on the time you spend in doing it. If you spend proper time on it, you can benefit a lot form it. Firstly, doing a part-time job can enrich the students' social experiences. He will meet all kinds of people in his job and during this period, he learns how to deal with them. This can improve his ability in communicating with others. What's more, it's not until a student makes money by himself will that he knows that making a live is not an easy thing. And in this case, he will be more understanding towards his parents and learn to arrange his money properly. However, it also has disadvantages if you spend too much time on it. For our studying time can't be guaranteed. For us students, studying is our major duty and once you have a part-time job, the problems in your job will make you cannot be absorbed in your major study fully. So, just as each coin has two sides, doing a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages. It's all up to you whether you can really learn something from it.
﻿According to the Chinese governments' announcement, smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country since Jan. 1, 2011. People have been discussing heatedly heather this ban should be taken into effect since the news came out. Of course, for non-smokers, it is really beneficial to them. But for smokers, they think it is too strict and unrealistic. Personally, I approve of it very much. First of all, for many customers, who spend much money in going to the restaurants, they just want to enjoy a nice meal and have a good time here, but with the irritating smoke surrounding them, how can they feel comfortable? What's more, as we all know, smoking does harm to not only the smoker himself, but also the people around him, whom we usually call second hand smokers. On one hand, the burning tobacco smoke contains more than 20 kinds of toxic hazards to life, among which the nicotine is the largest killer that can increase the risk of heart disease and lung cancer greatly. On the other hand, scientists find that non-smoker experience psychological harm as well, when they are exposed to the smoke, their levels of depression and anxiety is increasing. Eventually, let us look at the statistics showing that thousands of fire accidents are due to the litter of non-extinguished cigarette ends, not to mention the related deaths and losses. So, mo smoking, no crying!Taking all the factors into account, I stick to the ban that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
