The experience gained from a part-time job is priceless. My first job was being a waitress at my parent's friend's restaurant. I thought being a waitress was to just be friendly and take orders and then the customers would leave you a generous tip for writing down their order so well. I had a positive outlook and attitude on my first day at work; however, things did not go as I had hoped for. First, I did not make myself clear enough to the cook when I asked him not to add garlic to a customer's dish. He mistakenly thought I said to add extra garlic to the dish and the customer was obviously not happy. Then, I spilled a cup of soda on a customer's blouse. To make things worse, one of the restaurant's most loyal customers demanded to speak with my manager because she accused me of spitting in her drink. Just from this one day of working, I learned that being a waitress meant much more than taking orders. You must live by the "customers are always right" motto and good communication is a must. I obviously was not a waitress for very long. My next job was a cashier at a supermarket. The ability to communicate well with patrons here was a very vital part of my job. Currently, I am a nail technician where my development of communication skills is very useful when working with my clients. Through my part-time jobs, I have come across many real world situations that I now have knowledge of.
﻿Well if you do then you will regret it later because not only will you possibly die but along with that you won t be very pretty. Now today a lot of girls and boys in their teens smoke now you may think so what but 5, 000 are under 18 and that means they could be 12 or going to the extreme 9. Now you don t have to have a cigarette in your hand to be smoking, if your parents smoke you get second hand smoke which is technically the same thing because you are still inhaling smoke actually even more. So now that you know a little of how smoking then here is a lot more. What I meant by if you start smoking then you won t be very pretty is not if you smoke for one day it s if you smoke for 10 to 36 years. Do you think that Julie Andrews got her wrinkles for smoking? NO SHE DIDN'T! Her wrinkles came from age and wrinkles from smoking are a big difference. Because wrinkles from age are well from age, but wrinkles from smoking are because the tobacco settles in your sink. Think of it this way your thirty and you wrinkles ALL over that would be because you smoke. Or maybe your 65 or 75 then your wrinkles are ok So as you can see smoking is bad for you, your health and your appearance. And this is just some things that can happen. So if you want to be on oxygen or have tracheal tube for the rest of your life then that s your choice but for the people that want to stop smoking do something before it s to late. Smoking kills.
