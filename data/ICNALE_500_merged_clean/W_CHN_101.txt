Nowadays many students tend to get a part-time job outside school. According to a recent survey, there is a dramatic increase in the number of students who devote time to extra-curricular activities, community involvement and part-time work. As students attach more importance to part-time job, is it virtually significant to do that?As far as I'm concerned, taking a part-time job is of necessity. In the first place, through working with other people, students can learn how to get well with others. It is a chance to develop interpersonal communication and the ability of settling problems with a team. In the second place, college students usually focus on academics, but known rarely about the society. Doing a part-time job is good for real life experience. It helps students learn how to adapt to the norms of the society they live in. In the third place, many students spend too much money and make their family under the financial pressure. Even though the majority of students can't accumulate much wealth from the job, it helps their parents to release from the burden to some extent. We do know that time is the most valuable and the most perishable of all our possessions. To my thinking, we should arrange our time properly to do part-time job and study hard at the same time. We should make sure that we put ourselves on a more competitive footing when we leave college.
﻿Have you ever met the situation that when you are enjoying the delicious food in a restaurant, suddenly the boring smoke flies into your noses It becomes much common to see people smoking in the restaurant, which often make non-smokers lose their appetite and feel annoyed to inhale second-hand smoke?On account that cigarette could help people eliminate the feeling of loneliness and depression temporarily, more and more people begin to smoke. According to the survey, there are a large number of people smoking among every age. We cannot prevent everyone from smoking, but we need to exert ourselves to protect people who don't smoke from breathing in the polluted air which attributes to the smokers. We all know what's in second-hand smoke, and also first-hand smoke for the smokers. Cigarette is poisonous. Nicotine in it is a drug, so is the carbon monoxide from smoke. People who smoke would in all probability suffer from a variety of diseases and die prematurely. The second-hand smoke is fatal to us the same as the first-hand smoke, perhaps even more harmful. For the benefit of non-smokers, smoking should be regulated in public places, especially in the restaurant. The smelly smoke not only ruins what could be a dainty morsel but also destroy people's health. Before we can advise all the smokers to abstain from smoking, I think there is absolutely no doubt that smoking should be banned in the restaurant in the country.
