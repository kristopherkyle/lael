 As we all known, the argument against smoking become normal. Nowadays smoking has been shown to be dangerous to our health, living environment as well as our life quality. From the survey about smoking in 2002, it's said that the number of smoker in China reached 13 hundred million, which took up a large number of the population. What's more, recent research has shown that non-smokers can 30 percent of smokers all over the world, suffer health problem if they spend long period of time with people who do smoke. So, people who smoke in the restaurants will do harm to people who are non-smokers around them. Those non-smokers all hate it. However, smoking undoubtedly helps many people to relax, especially when they are relaxing with friends in the restaurant. Though smoking does lots of harm, somebody would also argue that people should have the right to choose whether they smoke or not. In my opinion, people should not smoke in a room where there are non-smoker but surely they should be free to smoke where it is suitable. I suggest that public place like restaurant should seta special room for smoker to enjoy their "bad habits at will.
