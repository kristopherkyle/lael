In the world that business plays an important role in people's life, many people have to learn how to make money by themselves. College students have to do a part a time job in order to get some money and help decrease their parent's expenses. Many college students love to follow the fashion and trend. The behavior of Thai students is influenced by friends for example, they use BlackBerry mobile phone or we called BB. Now, Thai students believe that if they have BB, they will be praised by their friends. For the students who don't have BB, they will not accepted by their friends. This problem causes the students to beg for a large amount of money from their parents. In my opinion, I think that if the students want to buy the expensive thing, they should collect the money by themselves. The best way to find money is to do a part time job. There are many part time jobs available for the students. They can work in the department store such as BigC and Lotus, the restaurant such as KFC and McDonalds and the convenient store such as Seven-Eleven. All of these jobs can help them collecting the money to buy the expensive thing. The most important reason is they can also help their parents.
﻿Have you ever been worried about your health when you have to stay near someone who is smoking? This question is for the people who love their health. Many of them have bad experiences about the smokers when they visit the public places such as the park, the amusement park and the department stores. The restaurant is the place that seems to face this problem even though there is a space for smoking. This cannot help decrease the problem because the smoker who doesn't have a good manner still smokes in the food area. When I go to the restaurant, I sometimes find that it is boring to sit near the table which people are smoking. The bad smell destroys my appetite for the food. I also concern about the health problem. I have known that people who do not smoke will receive the bad smoke which can cause the cancer. In my opinion, in Thailand all the restaurants should ban smoking. There should be the penalty for the smoker who smokes in the public area especially in the restaurant. This will help decrease the health problem of the other people who do not smoke.
