Recently, taspo has been introduced in vending machine so as not to make young people smoke. This means that smoking is bad for them. In addition, a smoking man does harm to his near people with secondhand smoke. There are children as well as adults at restaurant. Although many restaurants have smoking seats, the seats and other seats are not separated. As a result, consumers cannot help breathing cigarette smoke. Some consumers at the restaurants hate the smoke. Restaurants are the place where we enjoy eating. For example, if people who don't like cigarette smoke breathe it at a restaurant, they can't enjoy eating and feel very bad. This is a disadvantage for the restaurant and for consumers. If I were restaurant owner, I might hesitate to ban smoking at all seats. That's because when a man who is a heavy smoker comes to a restaurant, he may be angry for banning smoking and eventually never come to visit the restaurant. Then he will go to restaurants that are allowed smoking. If smoking is completely banned by the law at all restaurants in Japan, I don't hesitate to have consumers ban smoking. Smokers will give up smoking at restaurants. Smoking not only gives no benefits, but does much harm. No smoking at the restaurants will have great benefits to many people.
﻿I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons. First, a part-time job gives good experience to us. For example, a tutor teaches subject to a high school student or a junior high school student. The tutor may think teaching is difficult. Even if the student can't understand, the tutor has to make every effort to make the student understand. That's because the tutor is given money. We can learn an importance and responsibility of working. Second, college students need a lot of money. Their parents usually pay much money for a course fee, house rent and others. The parents suffer from this money. In addition, the students wear different clothes every day. When I was high school student, I wore uniform. It was very easy for me to decide what clothes I should wear in high school. Then I didn't have to have a lot of clothes. Now, I need many clothes. I need a lot of money for clothes. If we don't have a part-time job, we have difficulty in lack of money. It is bad not to study at all for too much job. If we can do both study and a part-time job, we should have a part-time job.
