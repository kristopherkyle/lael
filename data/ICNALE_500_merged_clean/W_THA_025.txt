The students of college or university are teenage. They have responsible for everything. After study already, they have part time. So, should to have activity. Something is bad or good but you know? It is interesting. Because it is experience. It is outside of your class. You learn something. The job is good activity because you get strange experience and you can make money. My opinion about past time job of students. Government office should to support very much. Because it is good activity. They spend time for good. Get the many benefits. Like learn social relationship, take care the other people, etc. know what other people want and try to serve them happily. It is the process of training students to be as adults. They will learn from the managers and friends in the work. For example, if customer complaint about the company, how they deal with it. some customer may be unkind and ask for many things. It is how to keep patient and try to clam down but when trying to clam down, they must know the solutions. So I think the students when they have part time job they can be like adults learning how to work and deal with people.
﻿The restaurants are the public places for people. Because it has many people go to that place, like child, elderly. Eating is good, if we know to choose everything for myself. So, that has many factors. It is atmosphere, cleaning, savor, procedure, price, place, etc. And eating is bad. It many factors too, like smoking. It is a important cause of everything. I think about smoking in the restaurant. Smoking, it is bad for your health and the other people, like bad mouthed, bad tooth, get pollutant, bad looking. Addition, it is a cause of the bad atmosphere and the area has dirty. Eating is so bad too. So, should to ban smoking in the restaurant because it has many bad results for health, atmosphere and eating. This is not something far from us, it concerns our living and very close to. You may think that you have no right to do this but actually you can do. if you start from yourself not smoke in public places and restaurants, then you tell your member in your family not hurt people by smoking and make smell around those places, then tell or warn your friends or any others to not smoke in any place that can hurt others, the smoking can be stopped or reduced. See that, it's easy to do if you start from yourself and expand to other around you.
