Nowadays many people hold a pessimistic attitude towards college students' behavior, having part-time jobs. Whereas, as for me, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. First and foremost, it is a perfect oppotunity for experence-lacked college students to practice themselves. Part-time jobs open a new door for innocent students to touch and learn to adapt to the complex society, which can broaden their horizens and strengthen their abilities. Secondly, taking part-time jobs is also an approach to relaxing. As we know, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy. Then getting along with various kinds of people and working in a group bring a fresh feeling during part-time jobs. Last but not least, college students can also earn money via part-time jobs, which can help to support their life and realize the hardship behind every coin. As to those excuses for denying part-time jobs, it is a waste of time and has a bad impact on study. I don't think they are according. As mentioned above, taking part-time jobs is meaningful, which not only strengthen themselves, but also make them mature enough to set foot in the society. As to study, what is known to all is that appropriate practice contributes to study by combining the theory to practice. All in all, taking part-time jobs should be encouraged among college students.
﻿Recently several bans, forbiding smoking in all restaurants, have been published, which brings heated discussion. As far as I'm concerned, to those bans I can't agree more. The reasons are just as followed:First and foremost, smoking is basically harmful to people's health, especially to the lung, which can contribute to fatal disease, such as cancer. Secondly, restaurant is a public occasion, smoking there can not only hurt smokers themselves, but also do harm to those surrounded. What's worse, while there is pregnant woman in the restaurant, the harm can be catastrophic. Thirdly, smoking can lead to quarrelling, which will destroy the harmony and influence consumers' mood in the restaurant. For there are also many non-smokers, even some smoking-sensitive people. Last but not least, even considering that several smokers have been addicted in smoking, there are still many other space out of restaurant provided for them. All in all, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurant in the country. In order to realize this aim, it is not enough that only the government publish some bans. Citizens, both smokers and non-smokers, are ought to join in this compaign. Smokers can remind themselves that it is banned to smoke in the restaurant when they have the desire to take a cigarette out. Non-smokers can advice those who want to smoke during dinner not to do that instesd of just tolerating or direct quarelling. Only in that way can smoking be completely banned in all reataurants in the country.
