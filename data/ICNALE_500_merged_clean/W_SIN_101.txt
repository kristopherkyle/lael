Smoking leads to too many health and social issues that I would have to agree that most restaurants should ban customers from smoking. Under the utilitarian perspective, banning smoking would be better for the greater good. This is because customers may not want to be victim to second-hand smoking. In addition, with the warnings from the health promotion board, schools and other informational brochures about all the harm second hand smoking can cause, non-smokers are more wary and cautious with breathing in smoke. Although one may be able to understand why smokers may have picked up this addiction, they may not necessarily empathize with it. Hence, they may want to enjoy their meal peacefully without having the thoughts of breathing in smoke that may affect their health. In addition, this could also be beneficial for the restaurant as they made it clear to families or health-conscious individuals that their restaurant is strictly smoke free. On the other hand, it is impossible to ban smoking from all restaurants as it boils down to the concept or culture of the place. For example, in Clarke Quay, a location where night activities are most dynamic and lively in Singapore, one can naturally expect that people would like to relax and perhaps smoke a cigarette or two. 
﻿I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many benefits to having one. It not only acts as a source for extra pocket money but also helps students to better manage time. In addition, the student will be exposed to many new experiences that can only be achieved by working that particular job. For example, the student could get a job as a customer service officer and learn how to effectively deal with angry customers or discover their passion for this occupation. The latter would be extremely useful for college students who are unclear about their future career. Moreover, a part-time job would be useful for college students as they build up networks or forge new friendships. For instance, working in an events job, where most of them consists of mainly students, allows for one to know more people from different backgrounds or schools. However, a college student should also take note not to over-work and neglect their studies as being a student should be considered their full time job. Lastly, if college students feel that they are easily stress and are definitely not able to commit to both studies and working at the same time are better off without a part-time job as well.
