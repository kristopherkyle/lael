In my opinion, it is not important for college students to have a part time job. First of all, it may make worse learning because some people can't break time spend time to work more than learning. Functions of college students are learning. Should study hard and do to the best. Another reason, students are responsible for studying, not working so the part time job maybe get I can't do duty well. Moreover, working part time job is dangerous. Although part time job make experience for life but, if it is a bad experience it will make despond. It can make some students failed in their study and some of them need to quit school because the grade is not meet the standard of the policy. The duty is the main idea for having a part time job. For poor students, there are many scholarship from the governments, organizations, university that provided for them. if they think they want to study only but in the same way they want to help family about payment for study fee, they should ask for the scholarship rather than go out to work. But if they think that they don't want to have a debt with the governments, they should try to do some work but should not work too much till the study is failed. In conclusion, part time job must not for college students.
﻿I think, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. First, I feel Smoking is dangerous. Because all years will have many patients died from diseases caused by smoking such as, air bag aneurysms, lung cancer, etc. Smoking is impolite that many people will look smoker so bad person. Now, governments want to smoker down so they make advertising and activities campaigning for people not smoking. In addition, we usually see tag on the wall in public place Don't smoking can be seen that many people don't like smoker. In fact, the government should issue laws controlling smoking in restaurants and public places. In concluding, smoking doesn't have benefits and give harmful for smoker and people around you, too. The policy of the country about smoking in public places is announced in many years and the results is better and better. Many places respects it and don't allow customers to smoke. If police see any restaurants allow customers to smoke, the shop will be punished and the customers will be punished too so that is why the number is not high like in the past. But there are still many restaurants too that they don't follow the policy. What we can do is trying to watch out, keep our eyes on them and try to do our best to stop people to smoke in the restaurants.
