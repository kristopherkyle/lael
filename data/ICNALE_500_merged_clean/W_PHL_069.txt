For me, not that much unless you're really in need of the money that you can earn while having a part-time job. I do not agree completely because mainly you're studying, and in my opinion you only have to focus on your studies, having a part-time job can be very stressful, because you'll need to balance your studies as well as your job, I have friends that has a part-time job and at the same time studying and seeing them sleeping in the class makes me think that it is not really advisable that college students should really have a part time job, it can be done while having your summer vacation, because college students doesn't need to wake up very early to attend classes every summer plus you can have your own hard-earned money in summer, I 'm not saying that having a part time job is bad but I think it is not just advisable for college students like me, but if the need arises like if my parents can't afford to send me to my university anymore then maybe that's the time that I will consider having a part-time job, the same reason goes to the other college students like me.
﻿n my opinion, yes it should be banned in the restaurants because no one wants to smell the cigar smoke while eating, I 'm a smoker myself but I see to it that whenever I 'm in a public place like the restaurants I avoid smoking, because not all people are smokers and not all people like the sight and the smell of people smoking near them specially while eating and also I 'm a strong believer that second-hand smoking is far more dangerous than smoking it by yourself because at least when you are smoking there is a filter that can lessen the toxins that enter your body but if you're a second hand smoker then you don't have any filter that can block the toxins that you smell in the cigars. I may have my right and I do have the right to smoke if I want to, but my right ends when the right of others begin, so I 'm really into the banning of smokers in the restaurants, maybe then restaurant manager can designate a smoking area for the smokers a little too far from the people who are not smoking. It will be a great idea if all the restaurants will have a special-place for the smokers.
