Imaging your are enjoying your delicious meal when clouds of smoke surrounds you and a heavy smoker right beside you speaks out, whose breath is of tobacco. How will you feel at this moment and this place? You certainly lose your appetite and intend to escape from the man as soon as possible, will you?For me, I think that under no circumstances should smoking be allowed in public places, such as the restaurant. Reasons are as follows. First of all, it does no good for your health. Both the smoker and the second hand smokers are risking their health even their life on the cigarette. Every year, large amounts of people die of lung cancer just because of smoking too much. Everyone should realize that our life is really precious that it our duty to value it. Therefore stay away from the cigar not only for yourself but also for others surrounding you. Secondly, it is a bad behavior or habit for our adolescents to imitate. Smoking in front of others present is a bad manner, which not only make an awful impression on others' mind but mislead the children to regard it as an acceptable or even a cool action. Every adult should be mentally alert to set a good example, especially in the public place. In a word, let's create a smoke free atmosphere to enjoy our meal. Seriously speaking! No smoking at any restaurant in the country!
﻿Nowadays, more and more college students think it is of great value and necessity to get a part-time job. For me, I am also one of them. I fully agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, gaining a part-time job is not only for the purpose of earning much money. What values more is the experience you get to promote your capacity such as communication, independence, your solution to an issue, and so on. That is to say, you can do things on your own if you gain some experience from part-time job. Secondly, it is a good opportunity to be involved in the society, forming a foundation for your future work. We are students but we are adults now. Therefore, the campus is not the only place we should stay. Outside school, you will see more interesting things. However, what I want to say is that a job will certainly take much of your spare time that your may feel stressed. So you should learn to schedule your time before working. In that way, I believe you can balance your time and lead a colorful college life.
