Nowadays, many collegians start to work some part time jobs more than the past. It is a much discuss topic that should they work while they still study or should they only keep focus on their lesson. Many people think it is good that their kids have part time jobs but others do not think so. On the one hand, many people in favor of this opinion believe that part time jobs give many advantages for collegians. Firstly, it makes them have more responsible for example they have to take responsibilities in their jobs and have to keep studying in the same time. Furthermore, they will get new societies because they have to meet more people which might be difference from their friends in college. Moreover, they will handle their problems by themselves because they have to solve many problems while they are working such as envy people, bad customers, or even bad employers. On the other hand, others think that part time jobs have many disadvantages for collegians for example they might have not good management on time. For that reason, they might fail in their both jobs and lessons. What is more, they might have bad societies such as their friends at work might take drug, smoking, or gambling. So they might do as their friends do, and they might start to have bad habit. Followed that, if they start take drug or stuck with gamble, they might start to be a robber which is illegal. In conclusion, to have a part time job have both advantages and disadvantages. So I personally think that collegians should do part time jobs while they study with their parents' sight.
﻿Nowadays, many people start smoke more than the past especially in developed countries for example Japan, China and United State. Some people think that it should be banned in public while others disagree with it. On the on hand, some people might think that smoking should be prohibited in public places such as shopping malls, theatres, parks, and night clubs. As a result, smoking gives many disadvantages, for instance healthy problem, social disadvantage, or family disadvantage, not only for smokers but also people near them. Totally, smokers get less toxic from smoking than others near them. So it is the main reason that smoking should be prohibited in public places. On the other hand, some people might think that it will be limited smokers' freedoms under democracy. So it will be against constitution about human rights, if smoking has been banned in public at all. They think it should have some smoking areas for smokers where will not annoyed others in public places and smokers can smoking there. In conclusion, I personally think that it should not be banned in public places at all because it will be limited smokers' freedoms. At the same time, smokers should respect to others' freedoms as others respect theirs.
