In my opinion, I agree that a part time job is important to student college. The students in the college should get some part time job, because they will get money to pay each day. The college students should help there family by work in the part time job, because in the college student might use a lot of money and the money from there parents is not enough for them. Many people in the college might try to get a part time job for earn money to help there parent, because there parent can't give them much money. So this is the good way for people who want to study but have no money. The part time job not only the good way for students who want to get money, but it is the good way for people who want to get more experience. If who want to get more experience should get a part time job. The part time job could give many good thing to students and the part time job couldn't give a bad thing to students. If who want to get more money for help the parents, and want to get more experience, and get more good friends they should go to find a part time job or more than
﻿In my opinion I agree that the smoking should completely banded at all in the restaurant. When we go to the restaurant with family or with the lover, it surely that day is the special day. Of cause this day we want to see every thing might be good. When we go to the restaurant we will feel bad, when we see some one smoking or smell some smoke. the smoking smell can makes people don, t want to eat food and don't want to came to the restaurant again. Then the smell smoking might destroy the happy day. Most of people don't like the smell smoking, because when they smell its some people cant breathing. Especially, the smoking smell is not good for every body such as children, older, smoker. The smoking smell can make people to be cancer and then they might be died. So, when people know that the smoking is not good for every body the smoker should stop to smoking for there self and each other. If the smoker can stopped smoking in the restaurant and other places, when we go to the restaurant and other places we could get fresh air. Then we will fell happy every time and we might have a good healthy.
