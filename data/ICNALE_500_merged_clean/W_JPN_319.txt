Restaurants in where all people enjoy dishes are not private place but public place. It is various people in there; adults and children, family and couple, gentle men and women, noisy men and women, smoker and non-smoker, for instance. So if you have lunch in restaurant, you should think feelings of around people in there. If you are smoker, it is most important that think thinking of non-smoker. In fact, I think smoke of cigarettes harm taste of foods. And smoke of cigarettes harms growth of children in restaurant. People who want to smoke should smoke out of room after mealtime. Then smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For example, McDonald's near my home prohibits smoking in store because McDonald's think that smoke is obstacle for good taste of hamburger. It is very good idea! And it is truth for smoker that smoke harms dishes. So in now, some restaurants have sheets for smoker, but all restaurants should abolish the sheet, if they want all people to enjoy good dishes. Finally I want all restaurants to prohibit smoking in it and all people agree this thinking and enjoy food and conversation peaceful, cheerful in it.
﻿I agree the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Certainly, some people disagree this idea and think college students should spend the time instead the time of a part-time job. But, I have three reasons of agreement. First, I think a part-time job makes my independence. I notice the independence of money by earning by myself. So I thank my parents since I started a part-time job. Second, I made friends for a part-time job. There are fifteen college students and four students of all students are students of *** University. All people get along with well. My teacher said me, Why don't you do a part-time job of teaching? Teaching is high salary. Indeed, my salary of part-time job is 900 yen an hour. But I'm satisfied with my salary because I can make friends of various university. Finally, I noticed the real independence of word 'Arigatou!!'. My part-time job is waiting on customers. Before I started my part-time-job, I thought I can't speak my customers well. But I could speak my customers now. And I could notice the independence of 'Arigatou!!'. If my customers don't say anything when I bring dishes to my customers, I feel dislike and uneasiness. If they say me 'Arigatou!!', I'm very very happy!! So I want to service the customer well more and more!! This experience makes me say 'Arigatougozaimasu!' in other stores. Therefore I agree this idea very much!
