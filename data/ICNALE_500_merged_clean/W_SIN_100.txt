The purpose of a ban may be to create a healthier eating environment, and when combined with other measures the ultimate goal of a smoke-free country may be fulfilled. The bans in restaurants may be successful if it is imposed well. In Singapore, just as how smoking is disallowed in air-conditioned malls, public transport and other public amenities, the ban is only effective if the general society, including smokers, is agreeable to adhering to the ban. In many local food establishments, sections of outdoor areas have been marked out for smoking customers to limit the extent of smoke circulation. The immediate benefit of the complete ban appears to be to non-smokers. However, this further compounds the problems that smokers face. Previously met with the limited choice of restaurants which offer smoking areas or to settle for a smoke-free one, they now no longer have any restaurants at which to smoke and dine at the same time. The ban will not go down well with the smoking community. The sole fact that cigarette smoke is harmful to health does not seem to qualify a complete clampdown on smokers at restaurants. It is likely that the ban is also meant to create a cleaner society and send out a strong signal of deterrence to smokers by making smoking highly inconvenient. The ban may be part of greater plans to encourage smokers to quit and discourage other from picking up the habit. The observable situation in my country is that the demarcation of smoking areas in restaurants seems to be effective at providing for both smokers and non-smokers. An extreme and complete ban on smoking at all restaurants will not serve to dissuade smokers as much as it will cause great unhappiness among smokers, who should deserve their right to smoke and dine. 
﻿In most modern colleges, academic pursuits and achievements alone do not meet the goal of a holistic education. Other than co-curricular activities, internships and community involvements, the part-time job seems to be one of the ways for college students to pick up or practice skills beyond the classroom. The part-time job can be seen to be a sort of a school of hard knocks, where students get a taste of the working world by regularly embracing volatility and adapting to new situations. It also provides a side income to students. However, a part-time job does not appear to be of such importance when we consider well-off students who do not require the additional income. Students may also wish to focus on their studies in the school term, and only turn to short-term jobs in their vacation instead of struggling to juggle both work and studies simultaneously. In other cases, students may find that the opportunity cost of taking up a part-time job is too high, especially if the time can be spent on an internship that is of greater relevance and potential benefit to the mastery of his or her major. Some exceptions are however acknowledged. In times when a student faces financial distress and finds difficulty in covering college tuition fees and basic living expenses, this necessitates a source of income. It is financially wise to grow capacity before budgeting, and one of the ways for the college student to do so is to hold a part-time job. In this situation, a part-time job is a necessity, and its importance ranks equally high or even higher than other priorities of the student.
