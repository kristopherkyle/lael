First of all, I agree this statement, namely I think it is important for us to have a part-time job. There are three reasons why I think so. Firstly, a part-time job is a chance to get money that I can use freely. Now, I live in Rokko by myself and my parents send regular money to me once a month. I spend that money in living. The rest of that money is not so much. So I do not buy anything I like anytime. In short, we college students need money. Secondly, to do a part-time job is to join in a part of society indirectly, I think. When we graduate from this university after few years, we have to work in a complex society. Then, the more we have experience in a part-time job, the better we are. Thirdly, to do a part-time job is to get a chance making friends with. It is easy to making friends with by working together. In conclusion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
﻿Recently, in Japan many people got to know the risk and unnecessariness of smoking in society. Thus, I think it is necessary to ban from smoking at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reasons why I think so. Firstly, smell of dishes-sweet smell, sour smell and so on- is very important in restaurants. And the cigarette spoils a smell of the cooking. It is true that there is some person who wants to smoke while eating a dish or drinking liquor, but the smoking should be prohibited at the restaurant if we think about many other people. Secondly, the smoke of the cigarette may spoil equipment: for example, wallpaper or ornament in the restaurant. It is very wasteful if these things are very precious valuable things. Thirdly, the prohibition of smoking is a flow of the modern society. It becomes natural on a train and the platform. Or there are many places that you cannot smoke in the workplace. So it is thought that it is a matter of course to prohibit smoking at a restaurant. In conclusion, the smoking should be banned in all Japanese restaurants.
