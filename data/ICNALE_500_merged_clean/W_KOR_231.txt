I believe that smokers should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smokers have the right to smoke when and where they want. However the right should be limited in the range of not harming other people. Every human beings have rights to do what they want to do. However, if they all insist just their rights, there will be a lot of conflicts because some rights may be harmful to some groups of people. So the criterion for regulating the rights should be in the range of not annoying other people. For example, there are some places such as coffee shops or internet cafe that offer separate room for non-smokers or smokers only. This policy can guarantee all people's right to smoke and right no to smell smoke. Only in this case, smokers should be able to smoke in restaurants. Smoking is not only annoying non-smokers by its smell, but also it is very bad for our health. It is also proven that there is more harmful effect for people who breathe in the smoke than people who actually smoke. So smokers are kind of killing people by giving off the smoke. In conclusion, I strongly believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants for bad smell and harmful effects to our health.
﻿I think there are many important things for college students. Therefore, having a part-time job can be one of them, but it should not be the most important thing. The most important thing for college student is to study and examine their own field. The reason why they major in the subject is to study more in the subject they are interested in and to find a job that is related to their fields of study. If they need working experience, they can do internship during summer or winter breaks. Since most part-time jobs are serving in restaurants, or working in factories, they are not closely related to their fields of study even though it brings students good experience. Also, the reason for getting a part-time job is for earning some money. However, it is better to study hard and get a scholarship. Then, students can compensate the time of doing their part-time jobs. Students can have many experiences from other activities besides part-time job. For example, students travel around the country or abroad in order to broaden their perspectives. Or they can join some school clubs in order to learn and build up social relationship. Also, they can do volunteer work to help the poor or the physically-challenged. As I said above, there are many things to do for earning money or getting more experience except for part-time job. I did not mean that there is no need to do part-time job. I mean we can invest our time more reasonably doing many kinds of activities or focusing more on study depending on our purpose. Therefore, I believe that there are many more important things than doing part-time job.
