I agree with a part-time job of college students. I think that a part-time job of college students leads them to independence economically and mentally. First, college students who have part-time jobs can understand how hard to get even a little money. Then they use money carefully and deliberately. And if they want to study abroad, get driver's license, or travel, I think they had better pay these cost themselves. It is not good to depend on their parents. Second, their workplace is little society. There are complex human relations to seniors or juniors, and responsibility for their jobs. Before they join "real society, they should practice in advance. In fact I have two part-time jobs. There, I can learn polite attitude and words, and how to communicate with customer. And I get many good friends. Because they have different opinions from me, these influence my view of life. I think meeting various people develops me. I'm often scolded by my seniors, but it is also good experience for me and I think that I get patience. Surely, studying is not ignored. But it is only students who can experience many jobs such as waitress. In my school life, I want to do as many as I can.
﻿I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I hate smell and smoke of tobacco. I think almost people who don't smoke feel it too. So there will be many problems about smoking in the restaurants. First, smoke dirty wallpaper, curtain, and so on in the restaurants. Second, there are possibilities to occur a fire, and children may get burned by their tobacco. Third, because there are people who hate smoking, the restaurants have to separate smoking seats and nonsmoking seats. But because the number of smoking people is smaller than that of people who don't smoke, people who don't smoke can sit down on the smoking seats. It is unfavorable situation. The other reason why I think so is that smoking is bad for the health. For example, smoking lead to cancer. It affects not only themselves, but also people who are around them. I think that it may be impossible to ban smoking at all place in Japan. But the restaurants are the eating place. The smell of tobacco ruins the smell of dishes. And if all the restaurants ban smoking, perhaps the number of smoker in Japan may decrease. I wish everyone all over the world stops smoking.
